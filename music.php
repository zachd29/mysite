<h2 class="text-center">General Information </h2>
  <p class="text-center"> Miles Davis not only my favorite jazz musician of all time, he is my favorite musician of all time in general.  He created almost an album every year between 1951 and 1991. He single handedly invented a whole genere of music called jazz fusion. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians. His album Kind of Blue remains the best-selling jazz album of all time.  </p>
